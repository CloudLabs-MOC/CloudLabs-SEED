## 1 Overview

The learning objective of this lab is for students to get familiar with the concepts in the secret-key encryption
and some common attacks on encryption. From this lab, students will gain a first-hand experience on
encryption algorithms, encryption modes, paddings, and initial vector (IV). Moreover, students will be able
to use tools and write programs to encrypt/decrypt messages.
Many common mistakes have been made by developers in using the encryption algorithms and modes.
These mistakes weaken the strength of the encryption, and eventually lead to vulnerabilities. This lab
exposes students to some of these mistakes, and ask students to launch attacks to exploit those vulnerabilities.
This lab covers the following topics:

- Secret-key encryption
- Substitution cipher and frequency analysis
- Encryption modes, IV, and paddings
- Common mistakes in using encryption algorithms
- Programming using the crypto library

**Readings.** Detailed coverage of the secret-key encryption can be found in the following:

- Chapter 21 of the SEED Book,_Computer & Internet Security_: A Hands-on Approach, 2nd Edition,
    by Wenliang Du. See details at https://www.handsonsecurity.net.

**Lab Environment.** You can perform the lab exercise on the SEED VM provided by the Cloudlabs.

## 2 Lab Environment

In this lab, we use a container to run an encryption oracle. The container is only needed in Task 6.3, so you
do not need to start the container for other tasks.

**Container Setup and Commands.** Files needed for this lab are included in Labsetup.zip, which can be fetched by running the following commands.
- In the SEED VM Open the Terminal and run the following commands.
  
![01](media/01.png)

```
sudo wget https://github.com/CloudLabs-MOC/CloudLabs-SEED/raw/main/Cryptography/Secret-Key%20Encryption/Lab%20files/Labsetup.zip
```
```
sudo unzip Labsetup.zip
```
Enter the Lab setup folder, and use the docker-compose.yml file to set up the lab
environment. Detailed explanation of the content in this file and all the involved Dockerfile can be
found from the user manual, which is linked to the website of this lab. If this is the first time you set up a
SEED lab environment using containers, it is very important that you read the user manual.
In the following, we list some of the commonly used commands related to Docker and Compose. Since
we are going to use these commands very frequently, we have created aliases for them in the.bashrcfile
(in our provided SEEDUbuntu 20.04 VM).

- Run the following commands in the terminal.
```
sudo su
```

```
cd Labsetup
```

```
docker-compose build # Build the container image
```

```
docker-compose up # Start the container
```

All the containers will be running in the background. To run commands on a container, we often need
to get a shell on that container. We first need to use the "docker ps" command to find out the ID of
the container, and then use "docker exec" to start a shell on that container. We have created aliases for
them in the .bashrc file.
Open the new terminal window and run the following commands:
```
sudo su
```

```
docker ps --format "{{.ID}} {{.Names}}"
```
Replace the docker id with id

```
docker exec -it <id> /bin/bash
```
```
The following example shows how to get a shell inside hostC
$ dockps
b1004832e275 hostA-10.9.0.
0af4ea7a3e2e hostB-10.9.0.
9652715c8e0a hostC-10.9.0.

$ docksh 96
root@9652715c8e0a:/#
```

> **Note**: If a docker command requires a container ID, you do not need to type the entire ID string. Typing the first few characters will be sufficient, as long as they are unique among all the containers.

If you encounter problems when setting up the lab environment, please read the “Common Problems”
section of the manual for potential solutions.

## 3 Task 1: Frequency Analysis

It is well-known that monoalphabetic substitution cipher (also known as monoalphabetic cipher) is not
secure, because it can be subjected to frequency analysis. In this lab, you are given a cipher-text that is
encrypted using a monoalphabetic cipher; namely, each letter in the original text is replaced by another
letter, where the replacement does not vary (i.e., a letter is always replaced by the same letter during the
encryption). Your job is to find out the original text using frequency analysis. It is known that the original
text is an English article.
In the following, we describe how we encrypt the original article, and what simplification we have made.
Instructors can use the same method to encrypt an article of their choices, instead of asking students to use
the ciphertext made by us.

- Step 1: let us generate the encryption key, i.e., the substitution table. We will permute the alphabet
    from a to z using Python, and use the permuted alphabet as the key. See the following program.
    
```
#!/bin/env python
import random
s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
list = random.sample(s, len(s))
key = ’’.join(list)
print(key)
```
- Step 2: let us do some simplification to the original article. We convert all upper cases to lower cases,
    and then removed all the punctuations and numbers. We do keep the spaces between words, so you can
    still see the boundaries of the words in the ciphertext. In real encryption using monoalphabetic cipher,
    spaces will be removed. We keep the spaces to simplify the task. We did this using the following
    command:
 ```
 $ tr [:upper:] [:lower:] < article.txt > lowercase.txt
 $ tr -cd ’[a-z][\n][:space:]’ < lowercase.txt > plaintext.txt
 ```
- Step 3: we use the tr command to do the encryption. We only encrypt letters, while leaving the space
    and return characters alone.
```
$ tr ’abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’ ’sxtrwinqbedpvgkfmalhyuojzc’ \
     < plaintext.txt > ciphertext.txt
```

We have created a ciphertext using a different encryption key (not the one described above). It is included
in Labsetup.zip file, which can be downloaded from the lab’s website. Your job is to use the frequency
analysis to figure out the encryption key and the original plaintext.
We have also provided a Python program (freq.py) inside theLabsetup/Filesfolder. It reads
the ciphertext.txt file, and produces the statistics for n-grams, including the single-letter frequencies,
bigram frequencies (2-letter sequence), and trigram frequencies (3-letter sequence), etc.
```
$ ./freq.py
-------------------------------------
1-gram (top 20):
n: 488
y: 373
v: 348
...
-------------------------------------
2-gram (top 20):
yt: 115
tn: 89
mu: 74
...
-------------------------------------
3-gram (top 20):
ytn: 78
vup: 30
mur: 20
...
```
**Guidelines.** Using the frequency analysis, you can find out the plaintext for some of the characters quite
easily. For those characters, you may want to change them back to its plain text, as you may be able to get
more clues. It is better to use capital letters for plain text, so for the same letter, we know which is plain text


and which is cipher text. You can use the tr command to do this. For example, in the following, we replace
letters a,e, and t in in.txt with letters X, G, E, respectively; the results are saved inout.txt.
```
$ tr ’aet’ ’XGE’ < in.txt > out.txt
```
There are many online resources that you can use. We list some useful links in the following:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis: This Wikipedia page pro-
    vides frequencies for a typical English plaintext.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram: Bigram frequency.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram: Trigram frequency.

## 4 Task 2: Encryption using Different Ciphers and Modes

In this task, we will play with various encryption algorithms and modes. You can use the following
openssl enccommand to encrypt/decrypt a file. To see the manuals, you can type man openssl
and man enc.
```
$ openssl enc -ciphertype -e -in plain.txt -out cipher.bin \
-K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff \
-iv 0102030405060708
```
Please replace the cipher type with a specific cipher type, such as-aes-128-cbc,-bf-cbc,
-aes-128-cfb, etc. In this task, you should try at least 3 different ciphers. You can find the meaning
of the command-line options and all the supported cipher types by typing "man enc". We include some
common options for the openssl enc command in the following:

```
-in <file>      input file
-out <file>     output file
-e              encrypt
-d              decrypt
-K/-iv          key/iv in hex is the next argument
-[pP]           print the iv/key (then exit if -P)
```
## 5 Task 3: Encryption Mode – ECB vs. CBC

The file picoriginal.bmp is included in the Labsetup.zip file, and it is a simple picture. We
would like to encrypt this picture, so people without the encryption keys cannot know what is in the picture.
Please encrypt the file using the ECB (Electronic Code Book) and CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) modes,
and then do the following:

1. Let us treat the encrypted picture as a picture, and use a picture viewing software to display it. How-
    ever, For the .bmp file, the first 54 bytes contain the header information about the picture, we have
    to set it correctly, so the encrypted file can be treated as a legitimate.bmp file. We will replace the
    header of the encrypted picture with that of the original picture. We can use the bless hex editor
    tool (already installed on our VM) to directly modify binary files. We can also use the following
    commands to get the header from p1.bmp, the data from p2.bmp (from offset 55 to the end of the
    file), and then combine the header and data together into a new file.


```
$ head -c 54 p1.bmp > header
$ tail -c +55 p2.bmp > body
$ cat header body > new.bmp
```
2. Display the encrypted picture using a picture viewing program (we have installed an image viewer
    program called eog on our VM). Can you derive any useful information about the original picture
    from the encrypted picture? Please explain your observations.

```
Select a picture of your choice, repeat the experiment above, and report your observations.
```
## 6 Task 4: Padding

For block ciphers, when the size of a plain text is not a multiple of the block size, padding may be required.
The PKCS#5 padding scheme is widely used by many block ciphers (see Chapter 21.4 of the SEED book
for details). We will conduct the following experiments to understand how this type of padding works:

1. Use ECB, CBC, CFB, and OFB modes to encrypt a file (you can pick any cipher). Please report which
    modes have paddings and which ones do not. For those that do not need paddings, please explain why.
2. Let us create three files, which contain 5 bytes, 10 bytes, and 16 bytes, respectively. We can use the
    following "echo -n" command to create such files. The following example creates a file f1.txt
    with length 5 (without the-n option, the length will be 6, because a newline character will be added
    by echo):
```    
    $ echo -n "12345" > f1.txt

```
We then use "openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -e" to encrypt these three files using 128-bit AES
with CBC mode. Please describe the size of the encrypted files.
We would like to see what is added to the padding during the encryption. To achieve this goal, we
will decrypt these files using "openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d". Unfortunately, decryption
by default will automatically remove the padding, making it impossible for us to see the padding.
However, the command does have an option called "-nopad", which disables the padding, i.e.,
during the decryption, the command will not remove the padded data. Therefore, by looking at the
decrypted data, we can see what data are used in the padding. Please use this technique to figure out
what paddings are added to the three files.
It should be noted that padding data may not be printable, so you need to use a hex tool to display the
content. The following example shows how to display a file in the hex format:
```
$ hexdump -C p1.txt
00000000 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 49 4a 4b 4c 0a |123456789IJKL.|
$ xxd p1.txt
00000000: 3132 3334 3536 3738 3949 4a4b 4c0a 123456789IJKL.
```
## 7 Task 5: Error Propagation – Corrupted Cipher Text

To understand the error propagation property of various encryption modes, we would like to do the following
exercise:
1. Create a text file that is at least 1000 bytes long.
2. Encrypt the file using the AES-128 cipher.
3. Unfortunately, a single bit of the 55th byte in the encrypted file got corrupted. You can achieve this
    corruption using the bless hex editor.
4. Decrypt the corrupted cipher text file using the correct key and IV.

Please answer the following question: How much information can you recover by decrypting the cor-
rupted file, if the encryption mode is ECB, CBC, CFB, or OFB, respectively? Please answer this question
before you conduct this task, and then find out whether your answer is correct or wrong after you finish this
task. Please provide justification.

## 8 Task 6: Initial Vector (IV) and Common Mistakes

Most of the encryption modes require an initial vector (IV). Properties of an IV depend on the cryptographic
scheme used. If we are not careful in selecting IVs, the data encrypted by us may not be secure at all, even
though we are using a secure encryption algorithm and mode. The objective of this task is to help students
understand the problems if an IV is not selected properly. The detailed guidelines for this task is provided
in Chapter 21.5 of the SEED book.

### 8.1 Task 6.1. IV Experiment

A basic requirement for IV is uniqueness, which means that no IV may be reused under the same key. To
understand why, please encrypt the same plaintext using (1) two different IVs, and (2) the same IV. Please
describe your observation, based on which, explain why IV needs to be unique.

### 8.2 Task 6.2. Common Mistake: Use the Same IV

One may argue that if the plaintext does not repeat, using the same IV is safe. Let us look at the Output
Feedback (OFB) mode. Assume that the attacker gets hold of a plain text (P1) and a cipher text (C1) ,
can he/she decrypt other encrypted messages if the IV is always the same? You are given the following
information, please try to figure out the actual content of P2 based on C2,P1, and C1.
```
Plaintext (P1): This is a known message!
Ciphertext (C1): a469b1c502c1cab966965e50425438e1bb1b5f9037a4c

Plaintext (P2): (unknown to you)
Ciphertext (C2): bf73bcd3509299d566c35b5d450337e1bb175f903fafc
```
If we replace OFB in this experiment with CFB (Cipher Feedback), how much of P2 can be revealed?
You only need to answer the question; there is no need to demonstrate that.
The attack used in this experiment is called the _known-plaintext attack_, which is an attack model for
cryptanalysis where the attacker has access to both the plaintext and its encrypted version (cipher text). If
this can lead to the revealing of further secret information, the encryption scheme is not considered as secure.


**Sample Code.** We provide a sample program called samplecode.py, which can be found inside the
Labsetup/Files folder. It shows you how to XOR strings (ascii strings and hex strings). The code is
shown in the following:
```
#!/usr/bin/python

# XOR two bytearrays
def xor(first, second):
return bytearray(xˆy for x,y in zip(first, second))

MSG = "A message"
HEX_1 = "aabbccddeeff1122334455"
HEX_2 = "1122334455778800aabbdd"

# Convert ascii/hex string to bytearray
D1 = bytes(MSG, ’utf-8’)
D2 = bytearray.fromhex(HEX_1)
D3 = bytearray.fromhex(HEX_2)

r1 = xor(D1, D2)
r2 = xor(D2, D3)
r3 = xor(D2, D2)
print(r1.hex())
print(r2.hex())
print(r3.hex())
```
### 8.3 Task 6.3. Common Mistake: Use a Predictable IV

From the previous tasks, we now know that IVs cannot repeat. Another important requirement on IV is that
IVs need to be unpredictable for many schemes, i.e., IVs need to be randomly generated. In this task, we
will see what is going to happen if IVs are predictable.
Assume that Bob just sent out an encrypted message, and Eve knows that its content is either Yes or 
No; Eve can see the cipher text and the IV used to encrypt the message, but since the encryption algorithm
AES is quite strong, Eve has no idea what the actual content is. However, since Bob uses predictable IVs,
Eve knows exactly what IV Bob is going to use next.
A good cipher should not only tolerate the _known-plaintext attack_ described previously, it should also
tolerate the _chosen-plaintext attack_, which is an attack model for crypt analysis where the attacker can obtain
the cipher text for an arbitrary plain text. Since AES is a strong cipher that can tolerate the _chosen-plaintext
attack_, Bob does not mind encrypting any plain text given by Eve; he does use a different IV for each
plain text, but unfortunately, the IVs he generates are not random, and they can always be predictable.
Your job is to construct a message and ask Bob to encrypt it and give you the ciphertext. Your objective
is to use this opportunity to figure out whether the actual content of Bob’s secret message is Yes or No. For
this task, your are given an encryption oracle which simulates Bob and encrypts message with 128-bit AES
with CBC mode. You can get access to the oracle by running the following command:
```
$ nc 10.9.0.80 3000
Bob’s secret message is either "Yes" or "No", without quotations.
Bob’s ciphertex: 54601f27c6605da997865f62765117ce
The IV used : d27d724f59a84d9b61c0f2883efa7bbc

Next IV : d34c739f59a84d9b61c0f2883efa7bbc


Your plaintext : 11223344aabbccdd
Your ciphertext: 05291d3169b2921f08fe34449ddc

Next IV : cd9f1ee659a84d9b61c0f2883efa7bbc
Your plaintext : <your input>
```
After showing you the next IV, the oracle will ask you to input a plain text message (as a hex string).
The oracle will encrypt the message with the next IV, and outputs the new cipher text. You can try different
plain texts, but keep in mind that every time, the IV will change, but it is predictable. To simply your job, we
let the oracle print out the next IV. To exit from the interaction, press Ctrl+C.

### 8.4 Additional Readings

There are more advanced cryptanalysis on IV that is beyond the scope of this lab. Students can read the
article posted in this URL:https://defuse.ca/cbcmodeiv.htm. Because the requirements on IV
really depend on cryptographic schemes, it is hard to remember what properties should be maintained when
we select an IV. However, we will be safe if we always use a new IV for each encryption, and the new IV
needs to be generated using a good pseudo random number generator, so it is unpredictable by adversaries.
See another SEED lab (Random Number Generation Lab) for details on how to generate cryptographically
strong pseudo random numbers.

## 9 Task 7: Programming using the Crypto Library

This task is mainly designed for students in Computer Science/Engineering or related fields, where pro-
gramming is required. Students should check with their professors to see whether this task is required for
their courses or not.
In this task, you are given a plain text and a cipher text, and your job is to find the key that is used for the
encryption. You do know the following facts:

- The aes-128-cbc cipher is used for the encryption.
- The key used to encrypt this plaintext is an English word shorter than 16 characters; the word can be
    found from a typical English dictionary. Since the word has less than 16 characters (i.e. 128 bits),
    pound signs (#: hexadecimal value is0x23) are appended to the end of the word to form a key of
    128 bits.

Your goal is to write a program to find out the encryption key. You can download a English word list
from the Internet. We have also included one in the Labsetup.zip file. The plaintext, ciphertext, and IV
are listed in the following:
```
Plaintext (total 21 characters): This is a top secret.
Ciphertext (in hex format): 764aa26b55a4da654df6b19e4bce00f
ed05e09346fb0e762583cb7da2ac93a
IV (in hex format): aabbccddeeff

```
You need to pay attention to the following issues:

- If you choose to store the plaintext message in a file, and feed the file to your program, you need to
    check whether the file length is 21. If you type the message in a text editor, you need to be aware that
    some editors may add a special character to the end of the file. The easiest way to store the message
    in a file is to use the following command (the-n flag tells echo not to add a trailing newline):


```
$ echo -n "This is a top secret." > file
```
- In this task, you are supposed to write your own program to invoke the crypto library. No credit will
    be given if you simply use the openssl commands to do this task. Sample code can be found from
    the following URL:
       https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/EVP_CipherInit.html
- When you compile your code using gcc, do not forget to include the -lcrypto flag, because your
    code needs the crypto library. See the following example:
```
    $ gcc -o myenc myenc.c -lcrypto
```
Note to instructors. We encourage instructors to generate their own plain text and cipher text using a dif-
ferent key; this way students will not be able to get the answer from another place or from previous courses.
Instructors can use the following commands to achieve this goal (please replace the word example with
another secret word, and add the correct number of # signs to make the length of the string to be 16):
```
$ echo -n "This is a top secret." > plaintext.txt
$ echo -n "example#########" > key
$ xxd -p key
6578616d706c
$ openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -e -in plaintext.txt -out ciphertext.bin \
-K 6578616d706c65232323232323232323 \
-iv 010203040506070809000a0b0c0d0e0f \
$ xxd -p ciphertext.bin
e5accdb667e8e569b1b34f423508c15422631198454e104ceb658f5918800c
```
