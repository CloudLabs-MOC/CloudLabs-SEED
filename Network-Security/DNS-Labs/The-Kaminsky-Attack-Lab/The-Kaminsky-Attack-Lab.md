## 1 Lab Overview

The objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand experience on the remote DNS cache poisoning
attack, also called the Kaminsky DNS attack. DNS (Domain Name System) is the Internet’s phone book;
it translates hostnames to IP addresses and vice versa. This translation is through DNS resolution, which
happens behind the scene. DNS attacks manipulate this resolution process in various ways, with an intent to
misdirect users to alternative destinations, which are often malicious. This lab focuses on a particular DNS
attack technique, calledDNS Cache Poisoning attack. In another SEED Lab, we have designed activities to
conduct the same attack in a local network environment, i.e., the attacker and the victim DNS server are on
the same network, where packet sniffing is possible. In this remote attack lab, packet sniffing is not possible,
so the attack becomes much more challenging than the local attack. This lab covers the following topics:

- DNS and how it works
- DNS server setup
- DNS cache poisoning attack
- Spoofing DNS responses
- Packet spoofing

Readings and videos. Detailed coverage of the DNS protocol and attacks can be found in the following:

    by Wenliang Du. See details athttps://www.handsonsecurity.net.

    athttps://www.handsonsecurity.net/video.html.

Lab environment. This lab has been tested on the SEED Ubuntu 20.04 VM. You can download a pre-built
image from the SEED website, and run the SEED VM on your own computer. However, most of the SEED
labs can be conducted on the cloud, and you can follow our instruction to create a SEED VM on the cloud.

## 2 Lab Environment Setup (Task 1)

Files needed for this lab are included in Labsetup.zip, which can be fetched by running the following commands.

```
sudo wget https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Files/DNS_Remote/Labsetup.zip
sudo unzip Labsetup.zip
```

The main target for DNS cache poisoning attacks is local DNS server. Obviously, it is illegal to attack a real
server, so we need to set up our own DNS server to conduct the attack experiments. The lab environment
needs four separate machines: one for the victim, one for the DNS server, and two for the attacker. The lab
environment setup is illustrated in Figure 1.
We put all these machines on the same LAN only for the sake of simplicity. Students are not allowed to
exploit this fact in their attacks; they should treat the attacker machine as a remote machine, i.e., the attacker
cannot sniff packets on the LAN. This is different from the local DNS attack.

### 2.1 Container Setup and Commands

Please download theLabsetup.zipfile to your VM from the lab’s website, unzip it, enter theLabsetup
folder, and use thedocker-compose.ymlfile to set up the lab environment. Detailed explanation of the
content in this file and all the involvedDockerfilecan be found from the user manual, which is linked
to the website of this lab. If this is the first time you set up a SEED lab environment using containers, it is
very important that you read the user manual.
In the following, we list some of the commonly used commands related to Docker and Compose. Since
we are going to use these commands very frequently, we have created aliases for them in the.bashrcfile
(in our provided SEEDUbuntu 20.04 VM).

$ docker-compose build # Build the container image
$ docker-compose up # Start the container
$ docker-compose down # Shut down the container

// Aliases for the Compose commands above
$ dcbuild # Alias for: docker-compose build
$ dcup # Alias for: docker-compose up
$ dcdown # Alias for: docker-compose down

All the containers will be running in the background. To run commands on a container, we often need
to get a shell on that container. We first need to use the"docker ps"command to find out the ID of
the container, and then use"docker exec"to start a shell on that container. We have created aliases for
them in the.bashrcfile.

$ dockps // Alias for: docker ps --format "{{.ID}} {{.Names}}"
$ docksh <id> // Alias for: docker exec -it <id> /bin/bash

// The following example shows how to get a shell inside hostC
$ dockps
b1004832e275 hostA-10.9.0.
0af4ea7a3e2e hostB-10.9.0.
9652715c8e0a hostC-10.9.0.

$ docksh 96
root@9652715c8e0a:/#


// Note: If a docker command requires a container ID, you do not need to
// type the entire ID string. Typing the first few characters will
// be sufficient, as long as they are unique among all the containers.

If you encounter problems when setting up the lab environment, please read the “Common Problems”
section of the manual for potential solutions.

### 2.2 About the Attacker Container

In this lab, we can either use the VM or the attacker container as the attacker machine. If you look at
the Docker Compose file, you will see that the attacker container is configured differently from the other
containers.

- Shared folder. When we use the attacker container to launch attacks, we need to put the attacking
    code inside the attacker container. Code editing is more convenient inside the VM than in containers,
    because we can use our favorite editors. In order for the VM and container to share files, we have
    created a shared folder between the VM and the container using the Dockervolumes. If you look
    at the Docker Compose file, you will find out that we have added the following entry to some of the
    containers. It indicates mounting the./volumesfolder on the host machine (i.e., the VM) to the
    /volumesfolder inside the container. We will write our code in the./volumesfolder (on the
    VM), so they can be used inside the containers.
    volumes:
       - ./volumes:/volumes
- Host mode. In this lab, the attacker needs to be able to sniff packets, but running sniffer programs
    inside a container has problems, because a container is effectively attached to a virtual switch, so it
    can only see its own traffic, and it is never going to see the packets among other containers. To solve
    this problem, we use thehostmode for the attacker container. This allows the attacker container to
    see all the traffics. The following entry used on the attacker container:
    network_mode: host

```
When a container is in thehostmode, it sees all the host’s network interfaces, and it even has the
same IP addresses as the host. Basically, it is put in the same network namespace as the host VM.
However, the container is still a separate machine, because its other namespaces are still different
from the host.
```
### 2.3 Summary of the DNS Configuration

All the containers are already configured for this lab. We provide a summary here, so students are aware of
these configurations. Detailed explanation of the configuration can be found from the manual.

Local DNS Server. We run the BIND 9 DNS server program on the local DNS server. BIND 9 gets its
configuration from a file called/etc/bind/named.conf. This file is the primary configuration file, and
it usually contains several"include"entries, i.e., the actual configurations are stored in those included
files. One of the included files is called/etc/bind/named.conf.options. This is where the actual
configuration is set.


- Simplification.DNS servers now randomize the source port number in their DNS queries; this makes
    the attacks much more difficult. Unfortunately, many DNS servers still use predictable source port
    number. For the sake of simplicity in this lab, we fix the source port number to 33333 in the config-
    uration file.
- Turning off DNSSEC.DNSSEC is introduced to protect against spoofing attacks on DNS servers. To
    show how attacks work without this protection mechanism, we have turned off the protection in the
    configuration file.
- DNS cache. During the attack, we need to inspect the DNS cache on the local DNS server. The
    following two commands are related to DNS cache. The first command dumps the content of the
    cache to the file/var/cache/bind/dump.db, and the second command clears the cache.
    # rndc dumpdb -cache // Dump the cache to the specified file
    # rndc flush // Flush the DNS cache
- Forwarding theattacker32.comzone. A forward zone is added to the local DNS server, so
    if anybody queries theattacker32.comdomain, the query will be forwarded to this domain’s
    nameserver, which is hosted in the attacker container. The zone entry is put inside thenamed.conf
    file.
    zone "attacker32.com" {
       type forward;
       forwarders {
          10.9.0.153;
       };
    };

User machine. The user container10.9.0.5is already configured to use10.9.0.53as its local DNS
server. This is achieved by changing the resolver configuration file (/etc/resolv.conf) of the user
machine, so the server10.9.0.53is added as the firstnameserverentry in the file, i.e., this server will
be used as the primary DNS server.

Attacker’s Nameserver. On the attacker’s nameserver, we host two zones. One is the attacker’s legitimate
zoneattacker32.com, and the other is the fakeexample.comzone. The zones are configured in
/etc/bind/named.conf:

zone "attacker32.com" {
type master;
file "/etc/bind/attacker32.com.zone";
};

zone "example.com" {
type master;
file "/etc/bind/example.com.zone";
};


### 2.4 Testing the DNS Setup

From the User container, we will run a series of commands to ensure that our lab setup is correct. In your
lab report, please document your testing results.

Get the IP address of **ns.attacker32.com**. When we run the followingdigcommand, the lo-
cal DNS server will forward the request to the Attacker nameserver due to theforwardzone entry
added to the local DNS server’s configuration file. Therefore, the answer should come from the zone file
(attacker32.com.zone) that we set up on the Attacker nameserver. If this is not what you get, your
setup has issues. Please describe your observation in your lab report.

$ dig ns.attacker32.com

Get the IP address of **[http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com)**. Two nameservers are now hosting theexample.com
domain, one is the domain’s official nameserver, and the other is the Attacker container. We will query these
two nameservers and see what response we will get. Please run the following two commands (from the User
machine), and describe your observation.

// Send the query to our local DNS server, which will send the query
// to example.com’s official nameserver.
$ dig [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com)

// Send the query directly to ns.attacker32.com
$ dig @ns.attacker32.com [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com)

Obviously, nobody is going to askns.attacker32.comfor the IP address ofwww.example.com;
they will always ask theexample.comdomain’s official nameserver for answers. The objective of the
DNS cache poisoning attack is to get the victims to askns.attacker32.comfor the IP address of
[http://www.example.com.](http://www.example.com.) Namely, if our attack is successful, if we just run the firstdigcommand, the one
without the@option, we should get the fake result from the attacker, instead of getting the authentic one
from the domain’s legitimate nameserver.

## 3 The Attack Tasks

The main objective of DNS attacks is to redirect the user to another machineBwhen the user tries to get to
machineAusingA’s host name. For example, assumingwww.example.comis an online banking site.
When the user tries to access this site using the correct URLwww.example.com, if the adversaries can
redirect the user to a malicious web site that looks very much likewww.example.com, the user might be
fooled and give away his/her credentials to the attacker.
In this task, we use the domain namewww.example.comas our attacking target. It should be noted
that theexample.comdomain name is reserved for use in documentation, not for any real company. The
authentic IP address ofwww.example.comis93.184.216.34, and its nameserver is managed by the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). When the user runs thedigcommand
on this name or types the name in the browser, the user’s machine sends a DNS query to its local DNS
server, which will eventually ask for the IP address fromexample.com’s nameserver.
The goal of the attack is to launch the DNS cache poisoning attack on the local DNS server, such that
when the user runs thedigcommand to find outwww.example.com’s IP address, the local DNS server
will end up going to the attacker’s nameserverns.attacker32.comto get the IP address, so the IP


address returned can be any number that is decided by the attacker. As results, the user will be led to the
attacker’s web site, instead of to the authenticwww.example.com.

### 3.1 How Kaminsky attack works

In this task, the attacker sends a DNS query request to the victim DNS server (Apollo), triggering a DNS
query fromApollo. The query may go through one of the root DNS servers, the.COMDNS server, and
the final result will come back fromexample.com’s DNS server. This is illustrated in Figure 2. In case
thatexample.com’s nameserver information is already cached byApollo, the query will not go through
the root or the.COMserver; this is illustrated in Figure 3. In this lab, the situation depicted in Figure 3 is
more common, so we will use this figure as the basis to describe the attack mechanism.
WhileApollowaits for the DNS reply fromexample.com’s name server, the attacker can send
forged replies toApollo, pretending that the replies are fromexample.com’s nameserver. If the forged
replies arrive first, it will be accepted byApollo. The attack will be successful.
If you have done our local DNS attack lab, you should realize that those attacks assume that the attacker
and the DNS server are on the same LAN, i.e., the attacker can observe the DNS query message. When the
attacker and the DNS server are not on the same LAN, the cache poisoning attack becomes more difficult.
The difficulty is mainly caused by the fact that the transaction ID in the DNS response packet must match
with that in the query packet. Because the transaction ID in the query is usually randomly generated, without
seeing the query packet, it is not easy for the attacker to know the correct ID.
Obviously, the attacker can guess the transaction ID. Since the size of the ID is only 16 bits, if the
attacker can forgeKresponses within the attack window (i.e. before the legitimate response arrives), the

Figure 3: The Kaminsky Attack
```
probability of success isKover 216. Sending out hundreds of forged responses is not impractical, so it will
not take too many tries before the attacker can succeed.
However, the above hypothetical attack has overlooked the cache effect. In reality, if the attacker is not
fortunate enough to make a correct guess before the real response packet arrives, correct information will
be cached by the DNS server for a while. This caching effect makes it impossible for the attacker to forge
another response regarding the same name, because the DNS server will not send out another DNS query
for this name before the cache times out. To forge another response on the same name, the attacker has to
wait for another DNS query on this name, which means he/she has to wait for the cache to time out. The
waiting period can be hours or days.

The Kaminsky Attack. Dan Kaminsky came up with an elegant technique to defeat the caching effect [2].
With the Kaminsky attack, attackers will be able to continuously attack a DNS server on a domain name,
without the need for waiting, so attacks can succeed within a very short period of time. Details of the attacks
are described in [1, 2]. In this task, we will try this attack method. The following steps with reference to
Figure 3 outlines the attack.

1. The attacker queries the DNS ServerApollofor a non-existing name inexample.com, such as
    twysw.example.com, wheretwyswis a random name.
2. Since the mapping is unavailable inApollo’s DNS cache,Apollosends a DNS query to the name-
    server of theexample.comdomain.
3. WhileApollowaits for the reply, the attacker floodsApollowith a stream of spoofed DNS
    response, each trying a different transaction ID, hoping one is correct. In the response, not only
    does the attacker provide an IP resolution fortwysw.example.com, the attacker also provides an
    “Authoritative Nameservers” record, indicatingns.attacker32.comas the nameserver for the
    example.comdomain. If the spoofed response beats the actual responses and the transaction ID


```
matches with that in the query,Apollowill accept and cache the spoofed answer, and and thus
Apollo’s DNS cache is poisoned.
```
4. Even if the spoofed DNS response fails (e.g. the transaction ID does not match or it comes too late),
    it does not matter, because the next time, the attacker will query a different name, soApollohas to
    send out another query, giving the attack another chance to do the spoofing attack. This effectively
    defeats the caching effect.
5. If the attack succeeds, inApollo’s DNS cache, the nameserver forexample.comwill be replaced
    by the attacker’s nameserverns.attacker32.com. To demonstrate the success of this attack,
    students need to show that such a record is inApollo’s DNS cache.

Task overview. Implementing the Kaminsky attack is quite challenging, so we break it down into several
sub-tasks. In Task 2, we construct the DNS request for a random hostname in theexample.comdo-
main. In Task 3, we construct a spoofed DNS reply fromexample.com’s nameserver. In Task 4, we put
everything together to launch the Kaminsky attack. Finally in Task 5, we verify the impact of the attack.

### 3.2 Task 2: Construct DNS request

This task focuses on sending out DNS requests. In order to complete the attack, attackers need to trigger
the target DNS server to send out DNS queries, so they have a chance to spoof DNS replies. Since attackers
need to try many times before they can succeed, it is better to automate the process using a program.
Students need to write a program to send out DNS queries to the target DNS server (i.e., the local
DNS server in our setup). Students’ job is to write this program and demonstrate (using Wireshark) that
their queries can trigger the target DNS server to send out corresponding DNS queries. The performance
requirement for this task is not high, so students can use C or Python (using Scapy) to write this code. A
Python code snippet is provided in the following (the+++’s are placeholders; students need to replace them
with actual values):

Qdsec = DNSQR(qname=’www.example.com’)
dns = DNS(id=0xAAAA, qr=0, qdcount=1, ancount=0, nscount=0,
arcount=0, qd=Qdsec)

ip = IP(dst=’+++’, src=’+++’)
udp = UDP(dport=+++, sport=+++, chksum=0)
request = ip/udp/dns

### 3.3 Task 3: Spoof DNS Replies.

In this task, we need to spoof DNS replies in the Kaminsky attack. Since our target isexample.com, we
need to spoof the replies from this domain’s nameserver. Students first need to find out the IP addresses
ofexample.com’s legitimate nameservers (it should be noted that there are multiple nameservers for this
domain).
Students can use Scapy to implement this task. The following code snippet constructs a DNS response
packet that includes a question section, an answer section, and an NS section. In the sample code, we use
+++as placeholders; students need to replace them with the correct values that are needed in the Kaminsky
attack. Students need to explain why they pick those values.

name = ’+++’


domain = ’+++’
ns = ’+++’

Qdsec = DNSQR(qname=name)
Anssec = DNSRR(rrname=name, type=’A’, rdata=’1.2.3.4’, ttl=259200)
NSsec = DNSRR(rrname=domain, type=’NS’, rdata=ns, ttl=259200)
dns = DNS(id=0xAAAA, aa=1, rd=1, qr=1,
qdcount=1, ancount=1, nscount=1, arcount=0,
qd=Qdsec, an=Anssec, ns=NSsec)

ip = IP(dst=’+++’, src=’+++’)
udp = UDP(dport=+++, sport=+++, chksum=0)
reply = ip/udp/dns

Since this reply by itself will not be able to lead to a successful attack, to demonstrate this task, students
need to use Wireshark to capture the spoofed DNS replies, and show that the spoofed packets are valid.

### 3.4 Task 4: Launch the Kaminsky Attack

Now we can put everything together to conduct the Kaminsky attack. In the attack, we need to send out
many spoofed DNS replies, hoping one of them hits the correct transaction number and arrives sooner than
the legitimate replies. Therefore, speed is essential: the more packets we can send out, the higher the success
rate is. If we use Scapy to send the spoofed DNS replies like what we did in the previous task, the success
rate is too low. Students can use C, but constructing DNS packets in C is non-trivial. We introduce a hybrid
approach using both Scapy and C (see the SEED book for details).
With the hybrid approach, we first use Scapy to generate a DNS packet template, which is stored in a
file. We then load this template into a C program, and make small changes to some of the fields, and then
send out the packet. We have included a skeleton C code inLabsetup/Files/attack.c. Students
can make changes in the marked areas. Detailed explanation of the code is given in the guideline section.

Check the DNS cache. To check whether the attack is successful or not, we need to check thedump.db
file to see whether our spoofed DNS response has been successfully accepted by the DNS server. The
following commands dump the DNS cache, and search whether the cache contains the wordattacker(in
our attack, we usedattacker32.comas the attacker’s domain; if students use a different domain name,
they should search for a different word).

# rndc dumpdb -cache && grep attacker /var/cache/bind/dump.db

### 3.5 Task 5: Result Verification

If the attack is successful, in the local DNS server’s DNS cache, theNSrecord forexample.comwill
becomens.attacker32.com. When this server receives a DNS query for any hostname inside the
example.comdomain, it will send a query tons.attacker32.com, instead of sending to the domain’s
legitimate nameserver.
To verify whether your attack is successful or not, go to the User machine, run the following twodig
commands. In the responses, the IP addresses forwww.example.comshould be the same for both com-
mands, and it should be whatever you have included in the zone file on the Attacker nameserver.

// Ask the local DNS server to do the query
$ dig [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com)


// Directly query the attacker32 nameserver
$ dig @ns.attacker32.com [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com)

Please include your observation (screenshots) in the lab report, and explain why you think your attack
is successful. In particular, when you run the firstdigcommands, use Wireshark to capture the network
traffic, and point out what packets are triggered by thisdigcommand. Use the packet trace to prove that
your attack is successful. Note that DNS results may be cached on the local DNS server after the firstdig
command is run. This could influence the results if you run the firstdigcommand before using Wireshark.
You can clear the cache using"sudo rndc flush"on the local DNS server, but that will require you
to redo the attack.

## 4 Guidelines

To implement the Kaminsky attack, we can use Scapy to do the packet spoofing. Unfortunately, the speed
of Python is too slow; the number of packets generated per second is too low to make the attack successful.
It is better to use a C program. This could be quite challenging to many students, because constructing DNS
packets using C is not very easy. I have developed a hybrid method, and have experimented with it in my
own class. Using this approach, students’ time spent on coding can be significantly reduced, so they can
spend more time focusing on the actual attack.
The idea is to leverage the strength of both Scapy and C: Scapy is much more convenient in creating
DNS packets than C, but C is much faster. Therefore we simply use Scapy to create the spoofed DNS
packet, and save it to a file. We then load the packet into a C program. Even though we need to send a lot
of different DNS packets during the Kaminsky attack, these packets are mostly the same, except for a few
fields. Therefore, we can use the packet generated from Scapy as the basis, find the offsets where changes
need to be made (e.g., the transaction ID field), and directly make changes. This will be much easier than
creating the entire DNS packets in C. After the changes are made, we can use the raw socket to send out the
packets. Details of such a hybrid method are provided in the Packet Sniffing and Spoofing chapter of the
SEED book [1]. The following Scapy program creates a simple DNS reply packet, and saves it into a file.

Listing 1:generatednsreply.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
from scapy.all import *

# Construct the DNS header and payload
name = ’twysw.example.com’
Qdsec = DNSQR(qname=name)
Anssec = DNSRR(rrname=name, type=’A’, rdata=’1.1.2.2’, ttl=259200)
dns = DNS(id=0xAAAA, aa=1, rd=0, qr=1,
qdcount=1, ancount=1, nscount=0, arcount=0,
qd=Qdsec, an=Anssec)

# Construct the IP, UDP headers, and the entire packet
ip = IP(dst=’10.0.2.7’, src=’1.2.3.4’, chksum=0)
udp = UDP(dport=33333, sport=53, chksum=0)
pkt = ip/udp/dns

# Save the packet to a file
with open(’ip.bin’, ’wb’) as f:
f.write(bytes(pkt))


In a C program, we load the packet from the fileip.bin, and use it as our packet template, based on
which we create many similar packets, and flood the target local DNS servers with these spoofed replies.
For each reply, we change three places: the transaction ID and the nametwyswoccurred in two places (the
question section and the answer section). The transaction ID is at a fixed place (offset 28 from the beginning
of our IP packet), but the offset for the nametwyswdepends on the length of the domain name. We can use
a binary editor program, such asbless, to view the binary fileip.binand find the two offsets oftwysw.
In our packet, they are at offsets 41 and 64.
The following code snippet shows how we make change to these fields. We change the name in our reply
tobbbbb.example.com, and then send out a spoofed DNS replies, with transaction ID being 1000. In
the code, the variableippoints to the beginning of the IP packet.

```
// Modify the name in the question field (offset=41)
memcpy(ip+41, "bbbbb" , 5);
```
```
// Modify the name in the answer field (offset=64)
memcpy(ip+64, "bbbbb" , 5);
```
```
// Modify the transaction ID field (offset=28)
unsigned short id = 1000;
unsigned short id_net_order = htons(id);
memcpy(ip+28, &id_net_order, 2);
```
Generate random names. In the Kaminsky attack, we need to generate random hostnames. There are
many ways to do so. The following code snippet shows how to generate a random name consisting of 5
characters.

char a[26]="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";

// Generate a random name of length 5
char name[6];
name[5] = 0;
for (int k=0; k<5; k++)
name[k] = a[rand() % 26];

## 5 Submission

You need to submit a detailed lab report, with screenshots, to describe what you have done and what you
have observed. You also need to provide explanation to the observations that are interesting or surprising.
